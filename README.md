# Story
This weekend project began with a captivating [YouTube video showcasing a self-parking car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMp6pq6_QjI), which inspired me to explore the world of Reinforcement Learning

# What
A self-parking car agent trained using Reinforcement Learning.

# How
- **Tools:** Unity ML-Agents Toolkit, C#

# Challenges
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tinkering with Precision:** Perfecting the agent involved experimenting with various reward functions to encourage the agent to park precisely in the center of the parking spot.

- ü§£ **Comical Mishaps:** Along the road to parking perfection, we encountered moments of hilarity as the car agent ventured into unexpected interactions with neighboring cars.

# Result
After countless iterations, our car agent emerged as a parking virtuoso, conquering quirks and uncertainties, but still retaining a sense of humor.
