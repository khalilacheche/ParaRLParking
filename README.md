# Story
This weekend project began with a captivating [YouTube video showcasing a self-parking car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMp6pq6_QjI). It ignited my passion for exploring Reinforcement Learning, leading me to embark on a journey to create an autonomous parking system using Unity.

# What
A self-parking car agent trained using Reinforcement Learning.

# How
- **Tools:** Unity ML-Agents Toolkit, Python, and TensorFlow.

# Challenges
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tinkering with Precision:** Perfecting the agent involved in-depth policy corrections and parameter adjustments. I experimented with various reward functions to encourage the agent to park precisely in the center of the parking spot.

- ü§£ **Comical Mishaps:** Along the road to parking perfection, we encountered moments of hilarity as the car agent ventured into unexpected interactions with neighboring cars.

# Result
After countless iterations, our car agent emerged as a parking virtuoso, conquering quirks and uncertainties.
